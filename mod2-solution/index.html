		<p>This roasted chicken recipe is the way my grandmother used to make it. This method results in the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.

		<h1>Beef</h1>
		<p>The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result.

		After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds.
